# Data Analysis of Online Retail
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from December 2010 to December 2011, with the goal of uncovering patterns and trends to guide strategic business decisions. The analysis encompasses data cleaning, descriptive analytics, statistical analytics, and the development of actionable insights. By leveraging these analyses, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of sales dynamics and customer behavior.

## Data Cleaning

The initial phase of this project involves rigorous data cleaning to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the dataset. This process is documented and executed within a Google Colab notebook, which can be accessed [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VltiIJjsm_WZctniclAJSNdanRjIwKmn?usp=sharing). Data cleaning addresses missing values, resolves inconsistencies, and prepares the data for further analysis, ensuring that subsequent findings are based on a robust dataset.

## Descriptive Analytics

In the descriptive analytics phase, we provide a high-level overview of the sales data. The analysis reveals a total of **5,176,450** units sold and **3,958** unique products, highlighting the breadth of the inventory. Monthly sales trends are examined to identify periods of peak activity and low sales. Notably, the **White Hanging Heart T-Light Holder** is identified as the most frequently sold item.

Additional insights include customer order frequency and recency, which help us understand purchasing patterns and recent customer behavior. We also calculate the average order value (AOV) to gauge typical customer spending. The data is further analyzed by country, revealing that the Netherlands has the highest average order value. Sales and customer data by country, as well as customer churn rates, are also detailed.

## Statistical Analytics

The statistical analytics phase delves deeper into the data using advanced techniques. RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis segments customers based on their purchasing behavior, providing insights into customer value and engagement. Product performance analysis evaluates which products are performing best in terms of sales, while cohort analysis examines customer retention and behavior over time.

Additionally, customer churn analysis identifies factors leading to customer attrition, and customer lifespan value calculations offer insights into long-term customer loyalty and revenue potential. These analyses are crucial for understanding customer dynamics and informing strategic decisions.

## Findings

Our analysis yields several key findings. We observe a total of **5,176,450** units sold and **3,958** unique products. Monthly sales trends highlight periods of high and low activity. The **White Hanging Heart T-Light Holder** stands out as the most frequently sold item. Insights into customer order frequency, recency, and average order value provide a detailed view of customer behavior.

Sales data broken down by country shows that the Netherlands has the highest average order value. We also identify the top 10 countries by transaction volume and analyze sales distribution based on `StockCode`, indicating which products are driving the most sales.

## Actionable Insights and Recommendations

Based on our analysis, we propose several actionable insights and recommendations. Focusing on high-revenue products with significant sales volumes can boost profitability. Segmenting customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior allows for more effective marketing strategies. Implementing loyalty programs and offering discounts can help retain existing customers.

Expanding the product range of top-selling items and targeting high-potential regions for growth are strategic recommendations for business expansion. Personalized marketing, informed by RFM analysis, can enhance customer engagement. Additionally, addressing customer churn with targeted retention efforts will help maintain a loyal customer base.

## Formulating Hypothesis

Several hypotheses are proposed based on our findings. Implementing a loyalty program is expected to increase customer lifetime value and retention. During peak sales months (August, September, October, November), promotional activities and discounts are likely to drive higher sales. Combining top-selling products with slower-moving items could increase overall sales. Strategies to retain customers who are likely to churn should be developed to sustain customer loyalty.
